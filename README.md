# MacChanger Tool
spoof Mac address of Linux os

Every networking device is assigned a MAC address by the device manufacturer, which uniquely identifies a device in the network. It is burned into the hardware i.e firmware by manufacturers to avoid malicious attacks after changing it but we can change it temporarily using this MacChanger tool.

A MacChanger is a tool that changes the MAC address to the desired (or random) address until that device is rebooted. Once, the device is rebooted, the MAC address of that device will be set to its original MAC address.

mac address spoofing is a technique for temporarily changing your Media Access Control (MAC) address on a network device. A MAC Address is a unique and hard coded address programmed into network devices which cannot be changed permanently. The MAC address is in the 2nd OSI layer and should be seen as the physical address of your interface. 

Moreover, MacChanger tool is designed for spoofing mac addresses of computer devices.
